            <p>
              As a scribe at one of the largest Mycenaean palaces, my duties include diligent accounting of all the goods within the storerooms. Today, I composed the following tablet in order to inventory the items within one of the palace armories. An illustration representing my tablet can be found above in the figure (fig.1). The illustrated linear B tablet (fig.1) can be roughly translated to the following English “The estate of the wanax (or king), includes four hundred and two small swords (or daggers) (fig.2), four thousand and fifty arrows, eighty-five spears (or javelins), one hundred and six garments (or pieces of armour), one hundred and eight helmets, for a total of four thousand seven hundred and fifty-one”. I will explain the significance of the words on the tablet, the form of the tablet itself, and what its contents represent about this part of the palace economy.
            </p>
            <p>
As a scribe, I documented the inventory items on a tablet that was made from “flat lumps of clay” (Chadwick 1968: 16). The tablet is “page-shaped” (Tomas 2013: 177), which is much wider than the other “elongated” (Tomas 2013: 177) shape. These two shapes were the main styles of Linear B tablets at the time. (Tomas 2013: 177). Inscribing information into the raw clay tablets was a delicate job and was done using a “needle-sharp stylus” (Chadwick 1968: 21). In the case that a mistake was made when writing on a tablet, a flat stylus was used to mark over the area that contained the mistake (Judson 2020: 527). This would result in noticeable marks on the tablet, that can be used to distinguish if changes had been made to it at any point (Judson 2020: 527). Changes to tablets such as correcting errors or writing mistakes, had to be done while the tablets were not fully dry (Judson 2020: 527). Once the tablet was dry, it was more difficult to make changes. A dried tablet would be modified, in cases where new or updated information, needed to be documented (Judson 2020: 527). It was not impossible to modify the tablets after they have dried, but it required more work than inscribing fresh clay. A special process must be used to soften the tablet to make it useable for writing again, this process consisted of adding moisture to the tablet until it was soft enough to write on again (Judson 2020: 527). Based on this information, it can be shown that the tablet in (fig.1) is unmodified, as the depth of the writing appears to be narrow and shallow, and there are no visible alterations.

<p>
The ability to document quickly as the scribe was essential. The scribal medium of the time was clay. All the writing on the clay tablet must occur before it dries, or else it would not be easy to work with. The tablets would start drying immediately after being formed, as moisture from the wet clay would escape into the environment, in the process known as evaporation. There were two main processes for fully drying finished tablets. These processes were letting the clay tablet sit out under the sun to dry over the course of a few days (Chadwick 1968: 21), or to heat the tablet to very high temperatures in a process known as ‘firing’ (Chadwick 1968: 16). As the tablet in (fig.1) is a red clay colour, this indicates that the tablet was fired, and not left out in the sun to dry. For a tablet to change to this colour, it indicates that “sufficient oxygen penetrated to the tablet while it was being burnt to cause oxidation, giving a pleasant red brick colour” (Chadwick 1968: 16).
</p>
<p>
The language used by scribes to inscribe information onto the clay tablets is Linear B. However, the use of Linear B was limited to the following applications: “the labelling of goods or compiling of inventories - lists of items for export, weapons and armour, temple dedications, personnel, palace goods, records of produce, and the like.” (Bryce 1999: 259). The tablet in (fig.1) is a list of the weapons and armour in a specific storeroom in the palace. This follows the requirement that Linear B be used only for accounting purposes.

<p>
The Mycenean Linear B tablets were designed as short-term documents, which provided detailed accounts of current debts, inventory, and people within the society (Judson 2020: 524). They were not used as long lasting, permanent records (Judson 2020: 524). This is shown by the fact that most Linear B tablets did not have any mention of time, which is important when documenting the chronology of past or future events (Judson 2020: 524). The tablet represented in (fig.1) bears no representation of time and can be presumed to be representing the current state of the storeroom. Linear B tablets were often discarded, and replaced numerous times throughout the year, in order to keep up to date records (Judson 2020: 524). When a Linear B tablet does not accurately depict the current state of recoded items, or when the tablet was no longer needed, it would be ground back into clay dust which could be then used to create new tablets (Chadwick 1968: 16). Therefore, the tablet given in (fig.1) is known to be recent, and up to date, as its unmodified existence represents that it is a current accurate representation of the items accounted for on the tablet. 
</p>
<p>
The king of the palace who is described in the tablet as the owner of the goods is known as the wanax. Within Mycenean societies the responsibility of orchestration of the acquisition and distribution of goods throughout the community was done by the king or wanax (Klaus 1988: 293). As the King generally lived within the palace, most of the people in the society lived in the area surrounding the palace. This made the palace the ideal centralized location for most of the transactions that occurred within the society. As the palace was easily accessible to the people in the surrounding area, this allowed for an efficient system where the palace would act as a place of collection and redistribution.
</p>
<p>
The Mycenaean economy did not function like the economies of the twenty first century. In a Mycenean society, the transfer of money for goods and services was not applicable. Instead, Mycenaean societies had a “central redistributive agency” (Lupack 2011: 207). This means the supply and demand of goods and services within the Mycenaean economy was dictated by one central power. The person in this position of central power was often referred to as the wanax or king. This type of economy is often referred to as a “palatial economy” (Lupack 2011: 207). A palace within a Mycenaean society would act as a place of storage, as well as centralized location where goods could be distributed to the people. The central power would acquire “food and raw materials needed by specialist craftsmen” (Lupack 2011: 207); which would be stored in palace storerooms until needed. The raw materials in these storerooms were used by craftsmen to manufacture finished goods such as clothing, weapons, or armour (Lupack 2011: 209). The crafted weapons and armour would be held in a specific storeroom, also known as an armory until needed by members of the military.

    </div>
  </div>
</div>
<p>
As the description of the Linear B tablet (fig.1) outlines the inventory of armour and weapons. It can be said that this part of the palatial economy was mainly used as a storeroom of items that are used in times of war. There are no raw materials such as wool or food in the Linear B tablet (fig.1), which the general population relied on the palace to distribute (Lupack 2011: 209). This indicates that the items in this storeroom would not be frequently redistributed as they are all finished products that are not needed for “daily sustenance” (Lupack 2011: 209) by the general population.
</p>
<p>
The surplus of items noted in the Linear B tablet (fig.1) has many possible meanings. One possible meaning is that the taxes of the people in the society were recently collected. As everyone in the society had an obligation to contribute taxes (Lupack 2011: 213). This could mean that finished goods present in the storeroom were recently collected as taxes. This would provide an explanation as to why the items are being recorded, as they are new arrivals to the palace. Another possible meaning is that the king is preparing for battle and needs an accurate count of his current stock of military equipment in order to determine if there is enough for each troop.
</p>
<p>
In conclusion, the clay Linear B tablet (fig.1) lists the inventory of items within a palace storeroom and represents a current, unaltered depiction of one of the many palatial storerooms. Considering that the material used was clay, the scribe was able to provide the king or wanax these tablets by marking Linear B script into the clay. The valiant efforts of the Mycenean scribes provided the wanax tools to maintain their economic system of redistribution within the society.
