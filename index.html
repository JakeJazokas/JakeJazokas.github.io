            In ancient Greek times, there existed a mysterious artifact contained within the adyton of a temple, identified as an Omphalos. It is known that many Omphaloi existed, as they have been excavated from various temples (Kuchel 2011: 387). However, the most important Omphalos is the one found in the temple at Delphi. During the lifespan of the Omphalos at Delphi, it was regarded by many to be the center of the world (Zeilinga de Boer 2007: 81). Homer’s texts eloquently describe the Omphalos as the “navel of the sea” in the Odyssey (Hom. Odys. 1.45-55). The current existence of the original Omphalos at Delphi is unknown. However, three Omphaloi have been excavated from the site of Delphi (Zeilinga de Boer 2007: 86). These excavated Omphaloi can provide insight into the original form and function of the Omphalos at Delphi.          </div>

            Greek mythology can be used to better understand the symbolism, and importance behind the Omphalos. In Greek mythology, Zeus sent out two eagles flying from opposite ends of the earth, with the intention that they would eventually meet in the center of the earth (Zeilinga de Boer 2007: 81). These eagles met atop the location of Delphi, and thus this location was declared to be the center of the earth and was marked with the stone Omphalos (Zeilinga de Boer 2007: 81). There has been art recovered from Sparta (<a href="#fig1">fig. 1</a>), which depicts the Omphalos with the two eagles sitting beside it (Zeilinga de Boer 2007: 87). This piece of art shows that the mythology behind the location of the center of the world was widely believed by ancient Greek society and that the Omphalos at Delphi was a physical representation of it.

            The three Omphaloi excavated from the site at Delphi (Zeilinga de Boer 2007: 86), shared a visibly similar resemblance to a “bee-hive” shape (Zeilinga de Boer 2007: 81) yet each one expressed a unique slight difference in appearance. One of the Omphaloi (<a href="#fig2">fig. 2</a>) is large, smooth in texture, and appears to be made of grey limestone (Zeilinga de Boer 2007: 86). This Omphalos was not found in the adyton of the temple but instead found beneath the treasury (Zeilinga de Boer 2007: 86). Another one of the Omphaloi (<a href="#fig3">fig. 3</a>) is large, made of marble, and is decorated with carvings across its surface (Zeilinga de Boer 2007: 86). This one was excavated outside the temple’s main entrance (Zeilinga de Boer 2007: 83). The final of the three Omphaloi (<a href="#fig4">fig. 4</a>) is small and appears to be broken at the bottom. This one was created using porous limestone (Zeilinga de Boer 2007: 82) and was excavated from the supposed adyton in “the southwestern corner of the temple’s basement” (Zeilinga de Boer 2007: 82).

            It is possible that one of the two undecorated Omphaloi (<a href="#fig2">fig. 2</a>) (<a href="#fig4">fig. 4</a>) could have been the original Omphalos from the temple at Delphi. Though their origin date is not known, they were likely carved by a skilled Greek sculptor, who would have possibly used a wooden guide in order to carve the precise curves seen on each side of the Omphalos (Kuchel 2011: 393).

            The decorated Omphalos (<a href="#fig3">fig. 3</a>) is believed to be a reproduction of the original Omphalos, created for pilgrims that came to visit the site (Zeilinga de Boer 2007: 83). It was likely carved by a Roman sculptor after the Romans had taken over Delphi in 168 B.C (Kuchel 2011: 392). It is believed that the top of this Omphalos once contained a small sculpture of two eagles, in reference to the myth of Delphi being the center of the world (Kuchel 2011: 392). This would further support the fact that this Omphalos (<a href="#fig3">fig. 3</a>) was created by the Romans, as the original Omphalos was described to have had a hole in the middle, that the Oracle would inhale fumes from in order to come to their revelations (Zeilinga de Boer 2007: 90). This fact renders the decorated Omphalos (<a href="#fig3">fig. 3</a>) unusable to the Greeks and leads us to the conclusion that it is instead a sculpture representing the usage and myth behind this once sacred object.           </div>

            Even though this (<a href="#fig3">fig. 3</a>) is likely not the original Omphalos at Delphi, it provides insight into how the Omphalos was used in religious ceremonies. In the image (<a href="#fig3">fig. 3</a>), you can see a pattern of netting carved into the Omphalos. This carving is thought to be a representation of the actual wool netting that would have been placed over the original Omphalos during these religious ceremonies. Then, the Omphalos was likely anointed with water or oil (Kuchel 2011: 392) by the Oracle of Delphi, also known as the Pythia. The Pythia was a powerful priestess who communicated with the God Apollo. This process was all an offering to the God Apollo, that would be performed whenever a person would come to the Pythia with a question. The Pythia would answer the question using Apollo’s wisdom, but never directly. The Pythia answered in the form of riddles that had to be interpreted by their recipient. During the life of the Omphalos, it was anointed many times with various liquids, as part of a religious ceremony done to gain insight from the God Apollo.          </div>

            In the end, it is not known what happened to the original Omphalos at Delphi. As it was considered a sacred item it would not have likely been disposed of. One possible explanation is that it was likely destroyed with the temple, as Delphi had been lost and buried since “the late seventh century CE” (Scott 2020: 59). It has been shown that “The temple of Apollo was certainly deliberately dismantled and its metal clamps ripped violently from their places” (Gregory 1983: 362). However, it is not known exactly who destroyed the temple, or when it happened, but it is likely that the temple was destroyed long after it had been abandoned (Gregory 1983: 362). Therefore, it is possible that the original Omphalos at Delphi was buried alongside the temple when it was originally lost. This would mean one of the artifacts that have been excavated might be the original. It is also possible that the original Omphalos was either destroyed or moved to another location, and thus has not been found.          </div>

            In conclusion, the Omphalos at Delphi was highly significant to society at the time, in both marking Delphi as the center of the world and its role in religious ceremonies. However, little is still known about its creator, and what happened to it after the fall of Delphi. There is a possibility that one of the Omphaloi excavated from the site at Delphi is the original, but for now, there is still no way to tell.          </div>
